#  Agent-Based Model to Investigate how Environmental Temperature Affects the Duration and Frequency of Emperor Penguin Huddles <br/>
The basic ecolab code have been provided by Dawn C Walker in COM3001 Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems<br/>

## Scope of functionalities 
This model is intended to investigate how environment temperature affect the penguin huddle. The environment temperature, numbers of penguins and the area of environment are input paramter for this model.

## Usage
To run modified model:<br/>

```
ecolab(The size of environment,The number of penguins,The numbers of iteration,The value of environment temperature, True/False of fast mode,True/False of out image mode)
```
For instance,
```
ecolab(100,10,200,-20,true,true)
```
It will generate the 100 square kilometer environment with 10 penguins. The iteration will process 200 times and environment is -20 degree. It will output image automaticlly and Fast mode is used.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks for Dawn C Walker provided the ecolab code to support us investigate agent-based model.
