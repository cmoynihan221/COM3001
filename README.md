# COM3001
The basic ecolab code have been provided by Dawn C Walker in COM3001 Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems
To run modified model:
ecolab(The size of environment,The number of penguins,The numbers of iteration,The value of environment temperature, True/False of fast mode,True/False of out image mode)
For instance, if we input : ecolab(100,10,200,-20,true,true)
It will generate the 100 square kilometer environment with 10 penguins. The iteration will process 200 times and environment is -20 degree. It will output image automaticlly and Fast mode is used.
